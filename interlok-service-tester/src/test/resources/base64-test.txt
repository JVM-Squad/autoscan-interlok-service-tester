JULIET  Ay me!
ROMEO   She speaks:
        O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
        As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
        As is a winged messenger of heaven
        Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
        Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
        When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
        And sails upon the bosom of the air.
JULIET  O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
        Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
        Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
        And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
  -- William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, Act II, Scene II
